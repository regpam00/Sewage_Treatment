## Summary :droplet: :microscope: :test_tube: :petri_dish: :dna:

  * This project investigated the bacterial communities in the impaired (poorly oxygenated) waters of Penn Cove that have been impacted by runoffs from developed and agricultural lands, freshwater flow from the Skagit River, and effluent from sewage treatment plants (STPs).
    
  * The data collected over four seasons examined prokaryotic/eukaryotic cell concentrations, carbon-based concentrations/productions, chlorophyll A concentrations, nutrient inorganic compounds, dissolved oxygen levels, salinity, and temperature at designated sites.
    
  * Metagenomic analyses of DNA fragments from collected specimens displayed an array of nanophytoplankton, eukaryotic phytoplankton, high-nucleic-acid bacteria, low-nucleic-acid bacteria, [_Synechococcus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechococcus) cyanobacteria, and others present in Penn Cove and surrounding areas.
